#Random Forest Integration on IV
This project attempts to implement RF into IV estimation and checks whether it improves on the standard method of 2SLS. DGP is based on an empirical paper ”Network effects and the dynamics of migration and inequality: Theory and evidence from Mexico”, which is concerned with relationship between inequality and migration prevalence and uses 2SLS as a way of dealing with possible endogeneity. We find that using RF in place of OLS in first stage of IV estimation gives better results under certain conditions.
